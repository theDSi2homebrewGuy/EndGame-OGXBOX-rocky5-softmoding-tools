A premade kit for rocky5's softmodding software utilizing the ENDGAME exploit.




	How to softmod a Original Xbox

NOTE: I don’t intend to claim credit, I’m just packaging it as it was hard for me, and I presume many others. The creators will be linked and I hope you support their efforts, I’m just distributing easy-to-copy and the easy to understand files. 

Big shoutout to the creators of the ENDGAME exploit, @shutterbug2000 and @gaasedelen on GitHub

And this wouldn’t even be possible if it weren’t for rocky5 who created the softmodding tools.

And thank the lords for the cheap Chinese USB to Xbox cords.

What’s needed, An Original xbox with cords and a controller, a USB to Original xbox cord, I recommend getting them from amazon, and a usb (I recommend under 256 megabytes) formatted with the Xplorer360 program, or the FATXplorer program. (If you have another program that you prefer that you like more, than use that, I do prefer you use Xplorer360 as it is what I used, then again, I was on windows 7 at the time.)


St ep 1, download the “softmodding.zip” file from packages.


Step 2, use Xplorer360 to somehow put the “softmod packages” (unzip the files before transferring for I:E, if transferring 007.zip unzip it to get the UDATA then transfer the UDATA folder) from the unzipped file to the USB, when done, reformat the USB with Xplorer360 and transfer the ENDGAME-2 folder and if that doesn’t work

Step 3, plug in the USB into the xbox with the adapter and navigate to the memory card/data management screen and click on the memory card/USB and it should run the exploit.

Step 4, Once on the menu, use the “NKitpatcher” option.
